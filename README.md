What I've learned in this project:

- Deeper knowledge on how the MVC pattern works
- Using rails to generate models, controllers, and migrations
- Looks like scaffolding ends up being very useful
- Used Sorcery to implement user authentication, and locked down parts of the application based on login status
- Used session tracking to manage login status 
- Role of the layout view as a universal wrapper for the application
- Using the routes table to wire up views to controller actions
- Used paperclip to implement file attachment
- How to manage many-to-many relationships by giving them their own model and controller
